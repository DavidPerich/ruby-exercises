# Write a program that asks the user to enter an integer greater than 0,
# then asks if the user wants to determine the sum or product of all numbers between 1 and the entered integer.

# input â€“ user inputs a value (as a string). Output is a string with interpolation of either product or value. 

# prompt user for input 
# capture and convert to interget
# prompt for what equation they want complete (product or sum)
# capture and downcase. 

# product interget to array reduce with * 
# sum = array.sum
# print as a string
