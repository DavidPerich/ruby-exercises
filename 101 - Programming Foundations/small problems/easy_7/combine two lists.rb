=begin
Write a method that combines two Arrays passed in as arguments,
and returns a new Array that contains all elements from both Array arguments, with the elements taken in alternation.

You may assume that both input Arrays are non-empty, and that they have the same number of elements.

# input â€“ two arrays. output is one array. 
# array are non-empty and the arrays of same number of elements. 
#   initialise a results array 
#   start a loop 
#   unshift the first value of the arr1 array 
#   unshift the first value of the arr2 array 
#   break if arr2.size == 0 
#   or go back to the start of the loop
# end the loop 
# return the results array. 

def interleave(arr1, arr2)

    results << arr1.shift
    results << arr2.shift
